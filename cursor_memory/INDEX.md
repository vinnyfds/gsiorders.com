## Project Memory Entries

### 2025-01-05_comprehensive_project_analysis.md
**Evidence-based project assessment: 45-48% complete (NOT 60% as previously claimed)**
- Missing components: InventoryManager.tsx, AdminDashboard.tsx don't exist
- 6 API endpoints return 404 (reviews, wishlist, upload, chatbot, tax, quotes)
