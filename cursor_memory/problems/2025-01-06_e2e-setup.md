## Problem

Initial E2E tests for the checkout flow failed due to:
- Playwright selectors not matching rendered elements (missing data-testid attributes).
- Test expected navigation to /checkout, but the app redirects directly to Stripe.
- Stripe test session URLs are dynamic, not static.

## Solution

- Added data-testid attributes to ProductCard, cart icon, proceed-to-checkout, and payment buttons.
- Updated E2E test to expect direct redirect to any Stripe URL (regex match).
- Confirmed E2E test passes with real app and MSW-mocked backend.
- Logged all setup and test commands to the P-15 command ledger.
